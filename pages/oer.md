### OER Researcher and Evaluator
In collaboration wtih a polymer scientist, I conduct research on OER-enabled pedagogy to develop and improve OERs (experiment simulator) for polymer science classrooms ([NSF Award #2142043](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2142043){:Target"_blank"}). Serving as the psychologist on the team, I design and assess the role of sociocognitive factors in students' learning with the interactive OERs. Our initial findings have been published in the [Journal of Chemical Education by ACS](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c01250){:Target"_blank"}.

My OER research is also supported by funding from [Open Education Group](https://openedgroup.org/fellows/){:Target"_blank"} through the OER Research Fellow program. One of the studies that come out of the fellowship project is [the research on OER for computational social science learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2023.1130865/full){:Target"_blank"}. 

### OER Creator
I create interactive materials for students to learn data analysis through my [RELACSS initiatives](https://manyu26.github.io/daisolab/teaching/relacss){:Target"_blank"}.

With the funding from LOUIS: LOUISiana Library Network [LOUISâ€™ Interactive OER for Dual Enrollment projectt through funding from the Department of Education](https://louislibraries.org/initiatives/affordable-learning/dual-enrollment/interactive-oer){:Target"_blank"}, I have worked with a team of psychology instructors to build a set of fully open, accessible OERs for students in dual enrollment introduction to psychology course. The final product is in the format of Pressbook. 

With the funding from the APA Div. 2 Society for the Teaching of Psychology (STP) [Instructional Resrouce Award](https://teachpsych.org/page-1610199){:Target"_blank"} and the American Psychological Association (APA) [CABE Teaching Resource award](https://www.apa.org/about/awards/ptcc-teaching-resources?tab=4){:Target"_blank"}, I have developed a R-learning OER, titled [R Programming Guide for Psychology Teachers and Students](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1310/overview){:Target"_blank"} and an assessment tool for teaching R in undergraduate classrooms, published in the [APA project assessment](https://pass.apa.org/){:Target"_blank"}. 

I am also the first author of the Personality Chapter of [Promoting Psychological Science](http://teachpsych.org/ebooks/promotingpsychscience){:Target"_blank"} in the APA STP e-book series.

### OER User
I am an instructor actively adapting OERs in all my courses. With the funding from the [LOUIS Affordable Learning LOUISiana Open Educational Resources Course Transformation Program through funding from the Louisiana Board of Regent](https://louislibraries.org/initiatives/affordable-learning/course-transformation){:Target"_blank"}, I have published my OER course adaptation tools and OER-enabled pedagogy documents for undergraduate-level Introduction to Social Psychology and Theories of Personality. The collections include a complete set of teaching courseware (syllabus, lecture slides, study guides, exam questions, in-class activities) that allows other instructors to easily transform their course into an OER course. 

### OER Peer Trainer and Reviewer
I have served as the mentor for [OE4BW](https://oe4bw.org/){:Target"_blank"}, an Open Education initative supported by UNESCO since 2022. In the program, I mentor faculty from under-resource regions of the world to develop high-quality, accessible open education materials. 

In 2021-2022, with the stipend from the Office of Distance Learning at UL Lafayette, I serve as the facilitator for a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) on [Open Educational Resources (OER)](https://louisiana.edu/distancelearning/news/inaugural-flcs-yield-results). Also, with the stipend and training from LOUIS OER Commons Faculty Cohort Program and LOUIS Open Education Network, I have contributed to the OER community by reviewing the scope, accessibility, adaptability, content accuracy, cultural relevance. I also served as a participant in user studies conducted by [ISKME](https://www.iskme.org/).
