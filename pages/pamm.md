### What is Psychology Academic Mentoring Matters

The Psychology Chapter of the Academic Mentoring Matters (PAMM) is a peer-mentoring program launched in 2021. The primary goal is to provide free tutoring for students one-on-one on various psychology courses. Mentors are students who have already taken classes in psychology and earned A's in the classes.
